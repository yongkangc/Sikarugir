# Sikarugir

This fork adds a measured performance investigation on Apple Silicon. See
[the profiling workflow](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) and
[the first local baseline](docs/BASELINE-2026-10-09.md).
The [gameplay code audit](docs/GAMEPLAY-AUDIT-2026-10-10.md) ranks runtime candidates
and includes reproducible source probes.
It currently contains profiling tools, a tested configurator patch and an
isolated DXMT HUD formatting candidate. It does
not yet provide a rebuilt Wine engine or a demonstrated game FPS improvement.
A wrapper project that's the successor to Wineskin\
This project supports *macOS 14.6* or later.
